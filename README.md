Website that fetches pictures from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day website

You need to have an environment variable called APOD_API_KEY with your NASA API key in it. 

Known issue - sometimes the "picture" of the day is a video, this app has no ability to handle these. 
Could also do with some better error handling.
